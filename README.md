Extracting Built-Up Area Using Google Earth Engine (GEE)
If you're looking to calculate the built-up area of any region using satellite data, this code is exactly what you need. Before running it, make sure you have the following:

✅ Prerequisites
A valid shapefile (.shp) of the region(s) you're analyzing. This defines your area of interest (AOI).

A registered and approved Google Earth Engine (GEE) account:
https://earthengine.google.com/

A basic project/environment set up in GEE's Code Editor.

🛰️ What This Code Does
This script uses Google Earth Engine to extract built-up area data for your region of interest. You can also modify or extend it to extract other land use indicators such as:

🌃 Nighttime lights (VIIRS/DMSP)

🌾 Cropland and vegetation cover

🛣️ Roads and infrastructure density

The results can be exported as:

Raster images

Tabular summaries

CSV files for further statistical analysis

💡 Why Use GEE?
Google Earth Engine allows you to:

Access massive global satellite datasets (e.g., Sentinel, Landsat, VIIRS)

Process geospatial data at scale using JavaScript or Python

Run cloud-based analysis without downloading terabytes of data
